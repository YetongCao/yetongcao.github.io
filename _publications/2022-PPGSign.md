### Abstract:
Handwritten signature authentication is a crucial service to defend against fraudulent activities. Existing automated solutions rely heavily on dedicated devices that are expensive and require different user efforts that affect the user experience. In this paper, we propose a new signature authentication system, PPGSign, which leverages Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors in the existing wrist-worn wearable devices. The unique blood flow changes in the supplicantâ€™s hand movement are exploited in this system to validate the signature. To make PPGSign nonintrusive and secure, we explore effective algorithms to separate the signature signals from the heartbeat signals in the raw PPG signals. We build a low-cost hardware prototype to verify our proposed method. Our experimental results show that PPGSign can achieve an average F1 score of up to 98%, which verifies the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution.
