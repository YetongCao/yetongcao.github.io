### Abstract:
Past tongue-jaw movement interaction systems typically require dedicated hardware and are uncomfortable to use, limiting their scalability and generalizability. This paper introduces CanalScan , the first system that recognizes tongue-jaw movements using commodity speakers and microphones mounted on ubiquitous off-the-shelf devices (e.g., smartphones). What inspires us is that tongue-jaw movements always cause ear canal deformations, and we find that for different tongue-jaw movements, dynamic features of ear canal deformations present unique patterns on acoustic reflections in the ear canal. Specifically, CanalScan first sends an acoustic signal to the ear canal, then parses the reflection signals for tongue-jaw movements recognition. To eliminate the impacts of body movements, we develop a body movement noise filtering method and a dynamic segmentation method to identify and separate the tongue-jaw movements-associated ear canal deformations from other types of body movements. We further propose a sensor position detection method and a data transformation mechanism to reduce the impacts of diversities in-ear canal shapes and relative positions between sensors and the ear canal. CanalScan explores twelve unique and consistent features and applies a random forest classifier to distinguish tongue-jaw movements. Extensive experiments with twenty participants validate the generalizability, effectiveness, robustness, and high accuracy of CanalScan.
