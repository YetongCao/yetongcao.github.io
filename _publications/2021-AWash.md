### Abstract:
Hand hygiene has a significant impact on human health. Proper handwashing, having a crucial effect on reducing bacteria, serves as the cornerstone of hand hygiene. For the elder with dementia, they suffer from a gradual loss of memory and difficulty in coordinating steps in the execution of handwashing. Proper assistance should be provided to them to ensure their hand hygiene adherence. Toward this end, we propose AWash, leveraging only commodity IMU sensor mounted on most wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches) to characterize hand motions and provide assistance accordingly. To handle particular interference of senile dementia patients in IMU sensor readings, we design a number of effective techniques to segment handwashing actions, transform sensory input to body coordinate system, and extract sensor-body inclination angles. A hybrid neural network model is used to enable AWash to generalize to new users without retraining or adaptation, avoiding the trouble of collecting behavior information of every user. To meet the diverse needs of users with various executive functioning, we use a state machine to make prompt decisions, which supports customized assistance. Extensive experiments on a prototype with eight older participants demonstrate that AWash can increase the user's independence in the execution of handwashing.
